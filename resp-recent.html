              quickly, but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways to
              simplify your life, a few of which we've explored in the past.

            <p>
              Simplicity and work Work is often a major source of stress. People
              get frustrated, it ruins their relationship with others and it
              leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible,
              it will help balance everything out.

            <p>
              A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
              don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the
              impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye
              where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
